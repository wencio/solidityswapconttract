# solidityswapcontract
Here is a basic example of a Solidity swap contract:
This contract allows users to deposit and withdraw funds, as well as exchange funds with other users by calling the swap function and specifying the recipient and the amount to be swapped. The balances mapping tracks the funds of each user. The require statements ensure that the user has sufficient funds and that the swap transaction is valid before executing it.
